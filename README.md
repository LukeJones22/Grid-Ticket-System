# Grid Ticket System

Grid Ticket System is a Java application which generates a 20x20 grid, randomly generating ten events over the coordinates of the grid. Events have up to five tickets available up to a maximum price of $400. The user inputs a pair of coordinates and the system returns the five nearest events in ascending order calculated by the Manhattan distance, displaying the cheapest ticket available.
